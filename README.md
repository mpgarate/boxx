# boxx

While developing use this to see debug statements in tests
```sh
RUST_LOG=boxx=debug cargo watch
```

#### A few TODOs
* Number type(s) beyond integer
* Human-readable errors
* pull tests into separate files
* clean up the parser in general
* split apart lexer and parser
* language-level exit command
