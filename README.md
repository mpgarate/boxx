# boxx

While developing use this to see debug statements in tests
```sh
RUST_LOG=boxx=debug cargo watch
```

#### A few TODOs
* [medium] Number type(s) beyond integer
* [hard] Human-readable errors
* [easy] pull tests into separate files
* [medium] clean up the parser in general
* [medium] split apart lexer and parser
* [easy] language-level exit command

# Pokemon
* [medium] function parameters
* [medium] if, else if, else (separate from ternary)
* [medium] some cleanup, but not too much
* [easy] print statement
* [hard] while loop
* [hard] at runtime, var name should be accessible (not purely substituted)
* [hard] REPL should maintain state
* [medium] ability to run standalone program files through interpreter
* [breaking] type coercion for bool to number
* [breaking] bike / mutable stack-like var binding
